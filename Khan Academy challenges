   SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type = "biking" OR type = "hiking" OR type = "tree climbing" OR type = "rowing";

/* IN */ is a shortcut or a neater way to write the querry above. type allows you to select individual items in a column 
/*NOT IN*/ does the inverse of the IN command, that is, what is not in ()
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");
*insert new table*
SELECT type FROM drs_favorites;

/subqueries/ 
-can select items that are in both tables in common 
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites);
    
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason = "Increases cardiovascular health");
 
 -This functions allows you to shorten the name in the actual table to find the one word that is common in the sentence 
 - the use of % is necessary to represent a wildcard that allows the function to work 
/* LIKE */

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");
Math operators may be used at any point in sql 
Round function may also be used in sql 

/CASE/ function is used to create a new column 

/* 50-90% of max*/
