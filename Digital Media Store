SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Country FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName,
       inv.InvoiceId, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN  chinook.customers AS cust 
ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil"
; 

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title like '%Sales%'; 

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT Distinct BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices;
